The Luamap Terrain Prototyper is a specialized web-based application designed for creating and visualizing procedural terrain generation algorithms for Minetest (also known as Luanti). It provides a node-based visual programming interface that allows users to design complex terrain generation logic without writing code directly, then exports functional Lua code that can be used in Minetest mods.
Core Components
1. Node-Based Visual Programming Editor

Node Categories:

Noise: 2D and 3D noise generators, Mandelbrot set
Operations: Mathematical operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Lerp, Coserp)
Position: Spatial coordinates and distance calculations
Terrain: Terrain type definitions, comparisons, and output


Node Connection System:

Connect output ports (right side) to input ports (left side)
Automatic type checking ensures compatible connections
Visual feedback with bezier curves showing data flow
Click connections to delete them


Parameter Controls:

Each node type has specific configurable parameters
Noise nodes: scale, spread, seed, octaves, persistence, lacunarity
Comparison nodes: operators (<, >, ==, etc.), true/false outputs
Terrain nodes: material type, color, properties



2. Real-Time 3D Terrain Viewer

3D Visualization: Shows the resulting terrain in real-time
Controls:

Resolution adjustment for detail level
Wireframe toggle for seeing internal structure
Scale presets (16, 256, 4096, 60000 units)
Camera controls for panning, zooming, and rotating



3. Lua Code Export

Generates valid Luamap mod code from the visual graph
Creates appropriate noise registrations
Implements the terrain logic function
Ready to use in Minetest/Luanti

Technical Requirements

Accurate Noise Implementation:

Must precisely replicate Luanti's noise algorithms with all their specific behaviors


Node Graph Editor:

Pan and zoom capability
Intuitive node placement and connection
Real-time updates when parameters change


Shader-Based Rendering:

Efficient terrain visualization using WebGL/Three.js
Support for different terrain materials and colors
Wireframe mode for exploring internal structure


Valid Lua Export:

Generate syntactically correct Lua code
Follow Luamap's API conventions
Include all necessary helper functions



Purpose and Workflow
The tool streamlines the terrain generation prototyping process by:

Allowing users to experiment with terrain algorithms visually
Providing immediate feedback through the 3D viewer
Eliminating the need to write code during the experimentation phase
Enabling the creation of complex terrain features through node combinations
Generating production-ready Lua code for Minetest/Luanti mods

Examples shown in the images demonstrate how users can create height-based terrain by connecting position coordinates to comparison nodes, using noise to add variation, and defining different terrain types (stone, air) based on conditions.
This tool bridges the gap between creative terrain design and technical implementation, making procedural terrain generation more accessible to Minetest mod developers.
